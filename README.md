# FOWLTY
FOWLTY is a MATLAB/Simulink toolbox designed to simulate offshore wind farms and introduce faults in different turbine subcomponents.

Note: The toolbox will be updated gradually, with changes documented in the Releases section.

For questions, issues, or feedback, users are encouraged to post in the Discussions section of this GitHub repository or email "ypena@mondragon.edu". However, please note that direct support is not guaranteed, and response times may vary depending on workload.

# INSTALLING THE TOOLBOX
To install and set up the FOWLTY toolbox, follow these steps:

1.- Download the latest version of the toolbox, and add the folder (and subfolders) to the Matlab path. Note that such folders (and subfolders) have to be included in the Matlab path to use FOWLTY, so it is recommended to do it every time Matlab is opened (by, for example, including them using the function "addpath" in Matlab's "startup" function).

2.- From the folder, run the "install.m" file. After this, restart Matlab. There should be a "FOWLTY" section on the Simulink library browser.

3.- Double-click on the "Farm Template" block, and follow the instructions to generate the desired farm.

4.- Once all the steps are finished, five different files should be generated in the selected folder:
   - a ".slx" file with the Simulink model of the farm;

   - a ".mat" file containing the wind information;
      
   - an initialisation file (".m") to initialise the required variables and run the Simulink farm model from MATLAB and visualise results (note that the model can also be run from Simulink once the initialisation file is run);
      
   - a function called "windRealisationGenerator.m" which can be used to generate more ".mat" wind files as specified in the next section;
      
   - and, if the faulty turbine model is selected, a file termed "faultScenarios.m" will also be included to define the desired faults.

# USING THE TOOLBOX
Once the wind farm model is generated, it is initially linked to a single wind file corresponding to a specific mean wind speed. However, it is possible to simulate additional wind conditions by generating new wind files. This can be done using the windRealisationGenerator.m function, which allows users to specify the original wind file along with the desired parameters for the new wind realization. It is important to select the original wind file to maintain consistency, as certain wind field variables must remain unchanged for the model to function correctly.

FOWLTY also allows users to define new turbine models by modifying the nrelvals.m file located in the nrel5mw/ folder. To do so, the user must create a copy of this file and modify the relevant parameters according to the specifications of the new turbine. Once the new turbine is defined, it must be integrated into the Simulink environment by opening lib_FOWLTY.slx, duplicating an existing turbine block, and making the necessary adjustments. After running the initialization script, the user will be prompted to select the newly created turbine block in Simulink. Once confirmed, the turbine will be registered, making it available as an option when creating wind farm models.
